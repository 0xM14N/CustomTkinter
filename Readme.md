# CustomTkinter
![](documentation_images/customtkinter_comparison.png)

With CustomTkinter you can create modern looking user
interfaces in python with tkinter. CustomTkinter is a
tkinter extension which provides extra ui-elements like 
the CTkButton, which can be used like a normal tkinter.Button,
but can be customized with a border and corner_radius.

CustomTkinter also supports a light and dark theme,
which can either be set manually or get controlled by
the system appearance mode (only macOS).

Detailed documentation is coming soon....
